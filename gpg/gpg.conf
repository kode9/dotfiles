# Common options for keyserver functions.
#
# include-revoked: When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys
# that are marked on the keyserver as revoked.Note that not all keyservers
# differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such keyservers
# this option is meaningless. Note also that most keyservers do not have
# cryptographic verification of key revocations, and so turning this option
# off may result in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked as revoked.
#
# include-disabled: When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys
# that are marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that this option is not
# used with HKP keyservers.
#
# honor-keyserver-url: When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a
# preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to refresh the key
# from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature being
# verified has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to
# fetch the key from. Note that this option introduces a "web bug": The creator
# of the key can see when the keys is refreshed. Thus this option is not enabled
# by default.
#
# honor-pka-record: If --auto-key-retrieve is used, and the signature being
# verified has a PKA record, then use the PKA information to fetch the
# key. Defaults to "yes".
#
# include-subkeys: When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential
# targets. Note that this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as they do not
# support retrieving keys by subkey id.
#
# timeout: Tell the keyserver helper program how long (in seconds) to try and
# perform a keyserver action before giving up. Note that performing multiple
# actions at the same time uses this timeout value per action. For example, when
# retrieving multiple keys via --receive-keys, the timeout applies separately to
# each key retrieval, and not to the --receive-keys command as a whole. Defaults
# to 30 seconds.

# This is an offline mechanism to get a missing key for signature verification
# and for later encryption to this key.  If this option is enabled and a
# signature includes an embedded key, that key is used to verify the signature
# and on verification success that key is imported. The default is
# --no-auto-key-import.
#
# On the sender (signing) site the option --include-key-block needs to be used
# to put the public part of the signing key as “Key Block subpacket” into the
# signature.
no-auto-key-import

# These options enable or disable the automatic retrieving of keys from a
# keyserver when verifying signatures made by keys that areauto-key-retrieve not
# on the local keyring.  The default is --no-auto-key-retrieve.
#
# The order of methods tried to lookup the key is:
#
# 1. auto-key-import
# 2. honor-keyserver-url
# 3. WKD
# 4. honor-pka-record
# 5. keyserver
#
# Note that this option makes a "web bug" like behavior possible.  Keyserver or
# Web Key Directory operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you
# a message signed by a brand new key (which you naturally will not have on your
# local keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and the time when
# you verified the signature.
auto-key-retrieve

# GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using this option.
# This happens when encrypting to an email address (in the "user@example.com"
# form), and there are no "user@example.com" keys on the local keyring.  This
# option takes any number of the mechanisms listed below, in the order they are
# to be tried.  Instead of listing the mechanisms as comma delimited arguments,
# the option may also be given several times to add more mechanism.  The option
# --no-auto-key-locate or the mechanism "clear" resets the list.  The default is
# "local,wkd".
auto-key-locate clear,local,wkd,dane

# Use this program to display photo user IDs
#
# %i is expanded to a temporary file that contains the photo.
# %I is the same as %i, but the file isn't deleted afterwards by GnuPG.
# %k is expanded to the key ID of the key.
# %K is expanded to the long OpenPGP key ID of the key.
# %t is expanded to the extension of the image (e.g. "jpg").
# %T is expanded to the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg").
# %f is expanded to the fingerprint of the key.
# %% is %, of course.
#
# If %i or %I are not present, then the photo is supplied to the
# viewer on standard input.  If your platform supports it, standard
# input is the best way to do this as it avoids the time and effort in
# generating and then cleaning up a secure temp file.
#
# The default program is "xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID 0x%k' stdin"
# On Mac OS X and Windows, the default is to use your regular JPEG image
# viewer.
#
# Some other viewers:
# photo-viewer "qiv %i"
# photo-viewer "ee %i"
# photo-viewer "display -title 'KeyID 0x%k'"
#
# This one saves a copy of the photo ID in your home directory:
# photo-viewer "cat > ~/photoid-for-key-%k.%t"
#
# Use your MIME handler to view photos:
# photo-viewer "metamail -q -d -b -c %T -s 'KeyID 0x%k' -f GnuPG"
#
photo-viewer "xdg-open %I"
